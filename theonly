<br>The Titanic was famed across the world. It was the pinnacle of scientific achievement. It was splendor, wealth and fame. But then, just like that, it was all over. For years, people have wondered why the ship sunk. While we may never know the answer, we can analyze different factors to give us a unique perspective on the “Unsinkable” ocean liner. In this essay, we will look at how the Titanic was born, How it sank and factors which contributed to vessel capsizing.</p>

<h2 style='color:blue'> How The Titanic Was Born</h2>


<p>It’s 1910, and you’re an executive in White Star Line. The Cunard brand of ships has taken the seafaring market by storm with the Luthisiana and Marithuania, the fastest ships on the earth. Your company needs a captivating ship if it wants any chance competing against these ships. Fortunately, you and your fellow execs have at trick up your(collective) sleeves.This trick was the Titanic. The Titanic was wider than a four lane highway, and longer than four city blocks. At the time of making, it was the largest ship ever built. According to “Titanic Disaster”, by Sonia Benson, The ship cost 400 million in today’s US dollars. The ship had four visible smokestacks, but only three were operational(the fourth one was for show). This vessel was made to impress. And impress it did. The CEO of White Star Line deemed the liner “Practically unsinkable”.
Unfortunately for him, many people forgot the "practically" part.</p>

<p1>It’s the Night of April 14, 1915. Aboard the Titanic, lookout Frederick Fleet is looking for anything that could impede the speeding vessel on route to New York. He’s mainly watching for icebergs, big or small. Suddenly, he sees something. It’s an iceberg! Not only that, it’s a big one and a close one. He immediately springs into action. DRIIING!!! He rings the warning bell 3 times. The officers order the engines into reverse. It looks like the ship and the iceberg might not collide. But unfortunately, It is too late. As the iceberg hits the ocean liner, there is a scrape, but not many passengers feel it. In the lower decks, however, it is a different story. The engine rooms begin flooding, among other rooms. The hull of the ship has 16 sections, each with doors, so flooding can be minimized. As the sections flooded,the bridge officer of the ship ordered to close all the doors. Unfortunately, this order came too late. The Captain knew the Titanic was doomed, so he ordered to release the lifeboats. Unfortunately, there were only 20 lifeboats on the ship, and some people would not be able to make it. As the lifeboats launch, everyone on the ship is ordered to get in a life vest. Once all of the lifeboats are detached, the captain declares “every man for himself”. The captain, as is tradition will be going down with the ship. 1,500 people remained on the ship. Most did not make it.</p1>
